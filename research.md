## From Education Technology to Learning Integrity 
I am interested in how educational technologies can be designed and used to support credible learning. Rather than relying on the detection tools or final outcome, my work focuses on learning integrity that reflects how students actually learn, engage and demonstrate understanding of the learning process. 


## 🎓 Foundations in Educational Technology
My early exposure to education technology began during my graduate studies and field-based research. During my master’s degree, my interest in Edtech became part of my thesis study, where I examined how teachers were prepared to use technology in their classroom using the TPACK framework. This study showed that while teachers had strong pedagogical knowledge, their technological confidence and ability to integrate technology varied widely. 

Through this work, I realized that education technology shapes how learning occurs and increases access to diverse learning opportunities. However, its impact depends largely upon its capability for effective implementation. This realization gradually shifted my focus from just adoption of educational technology to its implementation for making the learning processes visible and meaningful. 


## 🧩 Learning Integrity in the Age of Generative AI
With the widespread use of GenAI tools in education, a deeper challenge emerged of 

*👉 how educational technology can be designed to ensure learning credibility without undermining academic integrity?*

As I engage in GenAI and academic integrity tools related research, I observed that many approaches prioritized on detecting misconducts at final submission. This raised a question for me, whether the final submission can be the sole evidence of credible learning and academic integrity. 


## 🧠Learning Integrity as Process and Evidence
This led to my growing interest in learning integrity of whether learning activities, processes, and evidence genuinely reflect learners' understanding and engagement. 
My current research explores the 3P framework (Person, Process, Product) for academic integrity. This work suggests that educational tools need to address all three dimensions, as most prevailing tools provide only part of the picture, making academic integrity decisions hard and less fair. 


## 🌏 Knowledge Sharing
I have shared this work through workshops and presentations in both national and international settings, including in Kathmandu and Tokyo. These experiences have further shaped my perspective on the importance of designing educational technology that supports reflection, enables formative feedback and generates credible learning evidence.
